      "narrative": "We researched whether graph neural networks could predict molecular binding affinity without MD simulations. The uncertainty was fundamental: could GNN representations capture quantum mechanical interactions? Our hypothesis involved learned embeddings that encode electron density distributions. Initial experiments using standard message passing failed to predict binding energies within 1 kcal/mol accuracy. We tested attention mechanisms and equivariant layers as alternatives. After systematic evaluation across 15 protein-ligand datasets, we achieved 0.7 kcal/mol RMSE by combining spherical harmonics with learned force fields.",

      "narrative": "Our team investigated compression techniques for neural network weights without accuracy loss. It was uncertain whether 4-bit quantization could preserve model performance on vision transformers. We hypothesized that asymmetric quantization with learned scaling factors could work. Early tests with symmetric quantization degraded ImageNet accuracy by 5%. We experimented with mixed-precision strategies and per-channel calibration. Through iterative refinement, we discovered that outlier-aware quantization maintained accuracy within 0.3% while reducing model size by 75%.",

      "narrative": "We explored novel verification methods for autonomous vehicle perception systems. The core uncertainty was whether formal verification could scale to deep neural networks used in production. Our hypothesis centered on abstract interpretation combined with reachability analysis. Initial attempts using interval arithmetic produced overly conservative bounds, rejecting 80% of safe scenarios. We tested zonotope-based abstractions and SMT solver integration. After extensive experimentation comparing 7 verification approaches, we achieved 92% precision while maintaining soundness guarantees.",

The technical challenge: could we train diagnostic models without centralizing patient data while matching centralized performance? We hypothesized that secure aggregation with differential privacy could work, but initial experiments showed 15% accuracy degradation. We tested homomorphic encryption and secure multi-party computation as alternatives. Through systematic evaluation, we discovered that split learning with trusted execution environments achieved 99.2% of centralized accuracy while guaranteeing privacy.",

Uncertainty centered on whether event-driven computation could maintain accuracy while reducing power by 100x. Our hypothesis involved asynchronous spike propagation with adaptive thresholds. Initial designs using synchronous clocking consumed 45mW, missing our 0.5mW target. We experimented with adiabatic logic and subthreshold operation. After testing 12 circuit topologies and failing multiple times with leakage current issues, we achieved 0.48mW power consumption with 94% classification accuracy.",

After deployment, the system handled authentication more reliably and reduced token-related support tickets by 40%.",
