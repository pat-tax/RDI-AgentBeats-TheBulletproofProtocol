  Misclassified Cases                                 
                                                      
  1. NQ002 - False Positive (Expected NON_QUALIFYING →
   Got QUALIFYING)                                    
  - Narrative: "We improved the performance of our    
  search service by optimizing database queries and   
  adding caching"                                     
  - Issue: Agent incorrectly flagged routine database 
  optimization as qualifying research                 
  - Root cause: Narrative contains technical depth    
  language that may have triggered false positive     
                                                      
  2. Q010 - False Negative (Expected QUALIFYING → Got 
  NON_QUALIFYING)                                     
  - Narrative: "Deterministic replay of distributed   
  system executions...capture causality information   
  without prohibitive overhead"                       
  - Issue: Agent failed to recognize technical        
  uncertainty despite explicit documentation          
  - Root cause: Complex distributed systems           
  terminology may need better pattern recognition     
                                                      
  3. NQ008 - False Positive (Expected NON_QUALIFYING →
   Got QUALIFYING)                                    
  - Narrative: "Deployed a new monitoring             
  solution...dashboards using a popular observability 
  platform"                                           
  - Issue: Agent incorrectly flagged routine          
  observability setup as qualifying                   
  - Root cause: Similar to NQ002—operational terms    
  being misinterpreted                                
                                                      
  Score Distribution                                  
                                                      
  The Green Agent outputs normalized scores (0.0-1.0  
  range) rather than the 0-100 scale in ground truth: 
  - Qualifying narratives: 0.85-0.95 (average 0.90)   
  - Non-qualifying narratives: 0.55-0.82 (average     
  0.75)                                               
                                                      
  Clear separation exists, suggesting the scoring     
  mechanism is working correctly even with            
  misclassification edge cases.                       
                                                      
  Recommendations                                     
                                                      
  1. Improve boundary detection for narratives between
   routine engineering and genuine R&D uncertainty    
  2. Enhance pattern matching for complex distributed 
  systems terminology (Q010)                          
  3. Reduce false positives on                        
  operational/infrastructure changes (NQ002, NQ008)   
  4. Consider confidence thresholds - if the          
  classifier is uncertain, flag for manual review
